# stockprediction

In the project, we are trying to develop predictive models that forecast future stock prices based on past market prices and volatility.
In addition, we want to assess the impact that social media platforms have on the stock market and whether information from platforms like Twitter and Reddit have a large influence on stock prices 
We want to compare and contrast our models trained with solely data from bloomberg terminal/Yahoo finance vs twitter/sentiment analysis.

We will incorporate HMM model and perform 2 prediction. One prediction with our model and another one with our model added with sentiment analysis with twitter data.
